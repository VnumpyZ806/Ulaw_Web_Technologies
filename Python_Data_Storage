Comparison of Storage Mechanisms
Mechanism	Use Case	Pros	Cons
In-Memory	Temporary data, caching	Fast, easy to use, Non-persistent
Text/Binary	Logs, configuration	Simple, human-readable (text)	Limited structure, slower I/O
CSV	Tabular data, data export	Easy to read, widely supported	Limited structure, slow for large data
JSON	Configuration, web APIs	Human-readable, supports nested data	Not efficient for very large data
SQLite/Relational DBs	Structured, persistent data	ACID compliance, complex queries	Requires setup, less flexible
NoSQL	Unstructured, scalable data	Highly scalable, flexible schema	Complex queries can be limited
Pickle	Python objects, caching	Handles complex Python objects	Not human-readable, Python-specific
